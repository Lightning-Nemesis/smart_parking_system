# smart_parking_system
Our model is designed to use a low-cost hardware to detect the number of spots empty in the parking lot and to generate automatic bill for the user through interactive chatbot interface. The user will be informed the number of vacant spot left in a parking slot and a bill will be generated for him/her.
The model is split into two modules
  a) Detection of the number of slots
  b) User interface for the user and admin
